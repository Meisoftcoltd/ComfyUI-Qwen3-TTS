- **Flexible Attention**: robust support for `flash_attention_2` with automatic fallback to `sdpa` (standard PyTorch 2.0 attention) if dependencies are missing.
- **WSL2 Support**: Built-in path correction for WSL2 users accessing Windows drives (e.g., `Z:\` maps to `/mnt/z/`).

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository into your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` folder:
    ```bash
    cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
    git clone https://github.com/DarioFT/ComfyUI-Qwen3-TTS.git
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd ComfyUI-Qwen3-TTS
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
    **For portable/standalone ComfyUI installations**, use the embedded Python instead:
    ```bash
    # From your ComfyUI_windows_portable root folder
    .\python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -r ComfyUI\custom_nodes\ComfyUI-Qwen3-TTS\requirements.txt
    ```
    
    > ⚠️ **Note**: ComfyUI does not auto-install dependencies from `requirements.txt`. You must run the install command manually.
    
    *For GPU acceleration, ensure you have a CUDA-compatible PyTorch installed.*

    > ⚠️ **Dependency Note**: The upstream `qwen-tts` package requires `transformers==4.57.3`. This may downgrade your existing transformers version. If other custom nodes require a newer version, consider using a separate Python environment.

## Model Storage

Models and tokenizers are automatically stored in your ComfyUI models folder:
```
ComfyUI/models/tts/
├── Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice/
├── Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-VoiceDesign/
├── Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base/
├── Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-CustomVoice/
├── Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-Base/
├── Qwen3-TTS-Tokenizer-12Hz/          # For fine-tuning
└── prompts/                           # Saved voice embeddings (.safetensors)
```

**First-time use**: When you first select a model and run the workflow, it will be downloaded automatically. Only the model you select is downloaded—not all variants.

**Existing cached models**: If you previously used this extension and have models in HuggingFace (`~/.cache/huggingface/hub/`) or ModelScope (`~/.cache/modelscope/hub/`) cache, they will be automatically migrated to the ComfyUI models folder.

## Usage

### 1. Load Model
Use the **🎙️ Qwen3-TTS Loader** node.
- **repo_id**: Select the model you want to use.
  - `CustomVoice` models: For using preset speakers.
  - `VoiceDesign` models: For designing voices with text prompts.
  - `Base` models: For voice cloning and fine-tuning.
  - `Local: ...`: Your custom fine-tuned or manually downloaded models detected in the folder.
- **source**: Choose between HuggingFace or ModelScope for downloading (if model not already present locally).
- **local_model_path**: (Optional) Path to a locally trained/downloaded model (overrides repo_id).
- **attention**: Leave at `auto` for best performance (tries Flash Attention 2, falls back to SDPA).

### 2. Generate Audio

Connect the loaded model to one of the generator nodes:

#### **Custom Voice** (🗣️ Qwen3-TTS Custom Voice)
- **speaker**: Choose one of the 9 presets (e.g., Vivian, Ryan).
- **text**: The text to speak.
- **language**: Target language (or Auto).
- **instruct**: (Optional) Add emotional instructions like "Happy" or "Whispering".
- **Generation Parameters**:
    - **top_p** (default 0.8): Controls diversity.
    - **temperature** (default 0.7): Controls creativity/randomness.
    - **repetition_penalty** (default 1.1): Increase (e.g., 1.2) if the model stutters or enters infinite loops.

#### **Voice Design** (🎨 Qwen3-TTS Voice Design)
- **instruct**: Describe the voice you want, e.g., *"A deep, resonant male voice, narrator style, calm and professional."*
- **text**: The text to speak.
- **Parameters**: Same as Custom Voice (top_p, temperature, repetition_penalty).

#### **Voice Clone** (👥 Qwen3-TTS Voice Clone)
- **ref_audio**: Upload a reference audio file (1-10 seconds ideal, max 30s by default).
- **ref_text**: The transcription of the reference audio (improves quality).
- **text**: The text for the cloned voice to speak.
- **max_new_tokens**: Maximum tokens to generate (default: 2048). Increase for longer outputs, but higher values may increase hang risk.
- **ref_audio_max_seconds**: Auto-trim reference audio to this length (default: 30s, set to -1 to disable). Longer reference audio can cause generation hangs.
- **Parameters**: Same as Custom Voice (top_p, temperature, repetition_penalty).

### 3. Advanced: Prompt Caching & Voice Libraries

Use the **Qwen3-TTS Prompt Maker** node to pre-calculate the voice features from a reference audio. Connect the output `Qwen3_Prompt` to the **Voice Clone** node. This is faster if you are generating many sentences with the same cloned voice.

#### Saving Voice Embeddings

You can save voice clone prompts to disk for reuse without recomputing:

1. **Qwen3-TTS Save Prompt**: Takes a `QWEN3_PROMPT` and saves it to `models/tts/prompts/<filename>.safetensors`
2. **Qwen3-TTS Load Prompt**: Dropdown of saved prompts, outputs `QWEN3_PROMPT` directly usable by Voice Clone

**Workflow example:**
- First time: Voice Design → audio → Prompt Maker → **Save Prompt** (saves embedding)
- Reuse: **Load Prompt** → Voice Clone (instant, no recomputation)

## Fine-Tuning

Train a dedicated model for a specific voice.

1.  **Prepare Dataset**:
    - Organize a folder with `.wav` audio files and corresponding `.txt` transcripts (same filename).
    - Include a `ref.wav` (representative sample) in the folder, or specify it in the node.
    - Use **Qwen3-TTS Dataset Maker** node pointing to this folder. It generates a `dataset.jsonl`.
    
2.  **Process Data**:
    - Use **Qwen3-TTS Data Prep** node with the `dataset.jsonl`. It tokenizes audio and creates `*_codes.jsonl`.
    - **batch_size**: Control VRAM usage during processing (default: 16, lower if OOM).
    - Includes SHA256-based caching to skip reprocessing unchanged datasets.
    
3.  **Fine-Tune**:
    - Use **Qwen3-TTS Finetune** node.
    - **train_jsonl**: Connect the `*_codes.jsonl`.
    - **init_model**: Use `Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base` (or 0.6B variant).
    - **output_dir**: Where to save the new model.
    - **speaker_name**: Name your new voice.
    - **Advanced options**:
      - **resume_training**: Continue training from a checkpoint.
      - **gradient_checkpointing**: Enable for ~30-40% VRAM savings.
      - **use_8bit_adam**: Use 8-bit AdamW optimizer (requires bitsandbytes) for reduced VRAM.
      - **warmup_ratio**: Learning rate warmup (default: 0.1).
      - **gradient_accumulation**: Simulate larger batch sizes.
    - Run the node (Queue Prompt). Per-epoch checkpoints are saved automatically.
    
4.  **Evaluate Fine-Tuned Model** (Optional):
    - Use **Qwen3-TTS Audio Compare** node to compare reference vs generated audio.
    - Measures speaker similarity, mel spectrogram distance, and speaking rate ratio.
    
5.  **Use Fine-Tuned Model**:
    - Use **Qwen3-TTS Loader** and set `local_model_path` to your fine-tuned `output_dir/epoch_X`.
    - Use **Qwen3-TTS Custom Voice** node. Your `speaker_name` won't appear in the dropdown, you should type your exact trained `speaker_name` in the input, and it'll ignore the default voices and use the trained one.

## Troubleshooting

### Generation Hangs / GPU Stuck at 100%

The Qwen3-TTS model can occasionally enter infinite generation loops when it fails to emit an end-of-sequence token. This is a [known upstream issue](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS/issues/68).

**Symptoms:**
- Generation never completes, GPU stays at 100% usage
- More common with long reference audio (>30 seconds) or when generating long outputs

**Solutions:**
1. **Increase `repetition_penalty`**: Try setting it to 1.1 or 1.2. This is the most effective fix.
2. **Lower `max_new_tokens`** (default: 2048). Try 1024 for shorter outputs.
3. **Use shorter reference audio** for voice cloning (5-15 seconds is ideal). The `ref_audio_max_seconds` parameter auto-trims long audio (default: 30s).
4. **Kill the Python process** and restart ComfyUI if generation hangs.

### Slow Inference on Windows (Without FlashAttention)

FlashAttention 2 is not easily available on Windows. Without it, inference may be slower.

**Solutions:**
- Set **attention** to `sdpa` (PyTorch 2.0+ native attention) for decent performance.
- Use `eager` as a fallback if `sdpa` causes issues.
- Consider using WSL2 with Linux for FlashAttention 2 support.

### WSL2 Path Issues / "File Not Found"

If you are running ComfyUI inside WSL2 but accessing files on a Windows drive (e.g., `Z:\my_audio.wav`), this node suite automatically converts paths to their WSL equivalents (e.g., `/mnt/z/my_audio.wav`).

**Debugging:**
- Check the ComfyUI console for logs starting with `[Qwen3-TTS DEBUG]`. These logs show the exact path conversion taking place, as well as file counts for dataset creation and training progress.
